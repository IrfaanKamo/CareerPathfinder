Follow the steps below:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at all the posters available.</li>
<li>Think about ONE school subject you enjoy the most.</li> 
<li>Study this chart carefully of the school subject you like the most by studying the relevant Bullseye poster. Choose TWO jobs/careers/occupations after careful study of the poster.</li>
<li>Each poster has FOUR different circles on the poster which you have chosen.</li>
<li>Each circle or level of the poster represents different occupations/careers/jobs.</li>
<li>
Each Level of the poster also shows the  level of training which you will need in order to undertake that job
	<ul>
	<li><b>Level 1</b> shows jobs that only require you to have completed Grade 12. You may also be able to enter this job as 	an apprentice. </li>
	<li><b>Level 2</b> shows jobs that require a certificate. A certificate is most often a short course done over a few 	months or probably over a year. An example of this is completing the Microsoft N+ or A+ IT aligned certification. 	Another example could be going to chef school which normally takes around a year to complete before you progress 	to a job in the hospitality industry eg. Pastry Chef. Certificates or short courses are normally completed at 	private colleges. However, due to the lack of skills in many countries, universities and higher colleges of 		technology (HCTs) or universities of 	technology (UT) also offer short certificate courses. </li>
	<li><b>Level 3</b> shows jobs that require skills equivalent to a Diploma. A Diploma is normally completed via a 	university of technology or a higher college of technology. A recognised Diploma is normally offered over 3 years 	e.g. A 	National Higher Diploma in IT. Universities and private colleges may also offer Diplomas.</li>
	<li><b>Level 4</b> usually requires the completion of a Bachelor Degree or Higher qualification. This study is normally 	undertaken at university.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The FOUR education or training levels are to be used as a guide only. These levels indicate the most common education or entry requirements for occupations which are related to a poster you have chosen of your favourite (best liked) subject. Candidates must also look at their personality, career values, interests, abilities and career groups when making a career choice utilising the Bullseye poster. 
</p>

<p>
You may also make use of online search engines to research the careers that interest you before selecting them from the bullseye posters.
